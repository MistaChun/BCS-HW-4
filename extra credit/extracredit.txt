Extra Credit on Express.js
Express is a lightweight and fast frame-work designed to build web applications.
ful services, also called RESTful APIs, stands for Representational State 
Transfer. It is a convention for building HTTP services. They create, read, 
and delete data which all falls under CRUD operations. There are HTTP methods 
which are: Get, Post, Put, and Delete. All of these are used for the data 
received. These methods are used when requesting and then the response will 
give back the information desired based on which HTTP method is used. Express 
is used the same way you would use any other module by calling it with a require 
and then storing it in a constant or variable. It has all the methods from the
HTTP methods. When you have a get request, you put down a “/” to represent the
root of the website and then have another method as the callback function
(request and response). To summarize, the way express works is a user calls
in a request and then a response is created as a method with the website
url and callback functions to send back the response. Express can also 
use “listen” and put the response in a local host by putting out a port. 
Though arbitrary ports won’t work in production environments, a port variable is 
needed. Nodemon is used to monitor any changes in your source and automatically 
restarts your server. It can be installed by typing in “npm i -g nodemon”. This 
then requires you to type nodemon instead of node when trying to do runtime. It 
will restart when there are changes. When a client asks for a resource that does
not exist, there should be a 404 code saying that the code does not exist. This 
message has to be created in such case. You can test out HTTP services by using a
Chrome extension called Postman to see if it works. Input validation is used to
validate whatever the client writes down and should always be done to check what
the client writes down.
