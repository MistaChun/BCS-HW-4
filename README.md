# BCS-HW-4

This project is focused on using web APIs and local storage to create a functioning quiz application that will store any of the user's answers from the quiz. The quiz will indicate correct or incorrect on the user's choices and store it in the loca storage so that even when the page is refreshed, it will remain saved. There is a timer in the upper right-hand corner that will measure the time it takes for the user to complete the quiz. The longer it takes to complete the quiz, the lower the score will be. The shorter the time, the higher the score. The end score takes the duration of the quiz and the amount of correct answers picked and will display it at the end of the quiz.
